# PomodoroClock

This project is part of FreeCodeCamps Front End Development libaries.

This is a 25+5 Clock built using React Class Components. 

A Pomodoro clock is a time management tool used to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the Italian word for tomato ("pomodoro") after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that was originally used by its creator, Francesco Cirillo. The Pomodoro method is designed to improve productivity and focus by encouraging individuals to work in shorter, concentrated bursts, followed by brief periods of rest and relaxation. The Pomodoro clock is a physical or digital timer used to track these intervals and alert users when it's time to take a break or resume work.
